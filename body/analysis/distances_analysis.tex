How does parameterisation affect the estimates

Single chimps distance comparison:\\
Ideally, each and every manual distance should be joined to its corresponding modelled
distance estimate; however, due to the absence of any frame-position data associated
with the manual annotations, automating this using traditional algorithms is impossible
in circumstances where multiple chimps are captured in a single frame.
This is because when multiple individuals are detected, there is ambiguity in regard to
which distance a given modelled distance should be joined to.
Moreover, approaching this task manually is extremely labour-intensive and was therefore
outside the scope of this project.
As a result, this analysis focuses on distance comparisons associated with frames capturing
only a single individual.
