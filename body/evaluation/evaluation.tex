\section{Evaluation of Methodology}

Improvement over fully manual approach?

Bottlenecks, calibration frame preparation, available compute

Time saved using frame extractor, preserves exact pixels

Limitations of the environment

Calibration and detection frame image resolution

Depth estimation point consistency (the animal itself has depth)

Error in reference videos (person has depth, not always standing up straight)

Better calibration (polynomial/not just linear, more calibration frames)
