\subsection{Detection Frame Preparation}

Detection frame preparation is the process whereby the raw camera trap video of the dataset
is transformed into an array of representative images depicting the chimpanzees whose
distances to the camera will be estimated.
Two distinct frame sampling techniques were used in this study which will be referred to as
'manual' and 'automated' sampling.

Accompanying the raw camera trap video, another component of the dataset is a list of
human-annotated distance-to-camera estimates for all observed chimpanzees at a recorded
date and time along with additional metadata.
These distance data must be used a benchmark by which the accuracy of any modelled estimates
are assessed.

Before sampling, these data were first cleaned by running an automated script to flag any
identifiable abnormalities in the data such as duplicate entries and inconsistencies in the
date/time formatting.
These were then manually corrected.

In order to identify the correct frames to extract, each of the manual annotations was assigned
a timestamp corresponding to a time in seconds in which it was recorded in its associated camera
trap video.
These timestamps then constituted discreet identifiers of sampled frames.

Although the start-date/times of the videos were not explicitly labelled, assigning timestamps was
still possible since the date/time at zero seconds into a given video can be inferred as equal
to that of the earliest of all recorded annotations associated with the video.
This was a valid assumption to make as the overwhelming majority of videos begin exactly at the
point in which a chimpanzee enters the frame, thus corresponding to the first annotated observation.
In the few rare cases where this heuristic does not apply, all relevant timestamps were manually
corrected upon being flagged.
